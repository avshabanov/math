# Hashgraph Consensus Algorithm

* [Hedera's concepts](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/hashgraph-consensus-algorithms)
* [Whitepaper](https://www.hedera.com/hh_whitepaper_v2.1-20200815.pdf)

Traits:

* Performance (Cost, Throughput, Efficiency including State)
* Security: Async Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
* ACID Compliance
* DDoS Resilience
* Fairness (in terms of access, consensus timestamps, transaction order)
