 * 312. Burst Balloons
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/
 * <p>Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1.
 * Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums.
 * You are asked to burst all the balloons.
 * If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins.
 * Here left and right are adjacent indices of i.
 * After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.
 * </p><p>
 * Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
 * </p><p>
 * Note:
 * </p><p>
 * You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
 * 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100</p>
