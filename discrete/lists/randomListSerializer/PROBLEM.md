Given a single linked list, where each node also refers to any random node in a given list, write an algorithm to serialize and then deserialize such list.

In addition, certain nodes of that list may not contain extra reference to random node.

Example:

```
     +---------+
     v         |
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
|         ^
|         |
+---------+

```
