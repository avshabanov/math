# The Problem

```
Connect every node in a binary search tree with its nearest right sibling.
```

Example.

Source tree:

```
             7
            / \
           /   \
          V     V
         5      9
        / \      \
       V   V      V
      1     3     10
     /
    V
    0
```

Processed tree:

```
             7
            / \
           /   \
          V     V
         5----->9
        / \      \
       V   V      V
      1---->3---->10
     /
    V
    0
