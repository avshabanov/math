Given a series of numbers that form a binary tree, find the minimum weight binary tree.
The weight of the node is depth*(value of the element) plus weight of the left subtree and weight
of the right subtree.
Weight of the root node is the weight of the tree. Find the minimum weight binary tree out of all
binary trees that are possible.
