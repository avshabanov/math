Given a binary search tree, a key, an offset and limit return an array of ``limit`` size
that contains elements in sorted order greater than given ``key``, taking into an account given ``offset`` that
indicates how many elements greater than ``key`` should be skipped before constructing the resultant array.

You can think of ``offset`` and ``limit`` as of similar concepts in SQL pagination querties.
