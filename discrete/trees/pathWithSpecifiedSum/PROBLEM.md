Given a binary tree and a number, print out all of paths where the sum of all
nodes value is same as the given number.

The "path" here means a sequence of nodes, starting from root node and ending with leaf node,
each node in the path except for the first node in the path is a children of the previous node in the path.

I.e. given number 22 and tree:

```
    10
   /  \
  5    12
 / \
4  7
```

The possible paths are 10-12 and 10-5-7.
