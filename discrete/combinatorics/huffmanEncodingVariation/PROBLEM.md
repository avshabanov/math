# The Problem

Given an alphabet, where each character is uniquely represented with a sequence of '0' and '1' and an input string that
contains only '0' and '1' find all the possible representations of that string with characters in the given dictionary.

## Example

Dictionary: ``a -> 0``, ``b -> 1``, ``c -> 01``, ``d -> 11``

For input string: ``110`` output: ``bba``, ``da``.
For input string: ``0011`` output: ``aabb``, ``acb``, ``aad``.
