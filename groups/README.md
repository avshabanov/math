# Experiments in Group Theory

## TODO

* Support infinite groups with identity element plus producer functions
* Add support to verify groups homomorphism operation
* Add heuristics to verify group axioms for derived or produced groups
* Lie groups
* Detecting [automorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism)
* Add [Monster group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group) demo
* Add [Lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(discrete_subgroup)) demo
