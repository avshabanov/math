# Equinumerosity and Equinumerous Sets

Sets $A, B$ are equinumerous if there is a bijection between $A$ and $B$. Alternatively if $\exists T : \forall t \in T \implies t=\{a, b\} \land a \in A \land b \in B$ and 

1. $\forall a' \in A \implies \exists t' \in T \land a' \in t'$
2. $\forall b' \in B \implies \exists t' \in T \land b' \in t'$
3. $\not\exist t, t' \in T: t \neq t' \land ((a \in t \land a \in t') \lor (b \in t \land b \in t'))$

Prove equinumerosity of intervals $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$, given that $a < b \land c < d \land a, b, c, d \in R$.

---

Bijection:

1. From $(a, b)$ to $(c, d)$: $\forall x \in (a, b) \implies y \in (c, d): y = c + \frac{(x - a) (d - c)}{b - a}$
2. Conversely express $x$ from $y$. $\blacksquare$

1. Prove equinumerosity of any two circles on a plane.
2. Prove equinumerosity of any two figures, where each figure is an area within a certain circle on a plane.

1. Assuming any chosen coordinate axis common to both circles, any point within any circle could be represented by an angle $a \in [0, 360)$, therefore a bijection would be an angle for a given point on the first circle mapping the same point mapped to the same angle on the other circle.
2. Given any coordinate axis common to both circles any point within a certain circle could be uniquely represented by a pair $d, a$, where $d$ is a distance from the circle's center point and $a$ is an angle. Pairs $d_1, a$ for the first circle of radius $r_1$ and similar $d_2, a$ for another with radius $r_2$ form a bijection, so for every given point $d_1, a$ within the first circle the following would be true $d_2, a_2: a_2 = a, \frac{d_1}{r_1} = \frac{d_2}{r_2}$.
